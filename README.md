I know a retired Canadian soldier who toured in Bosnia during the occupation. He bragged to me. He is a religious nut. A freak. I am his cousin. Since he opened up to me my life has turned upside down, meeting Canadian Armed Forces cronies at every turn So I invite you to my city, Winnipeg, to aclimate and form a plan.
meet me at Trasers. let's set a time
on your dime
i know we can avoid CAF physically. And your European value would be valuable to see and hell navigate.
best. bill
