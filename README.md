- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @CIAopp
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...developing feed- replacing facebook slowly starting in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada using my awareness and my psychology university education and contract law
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...mathematics, paper spreadsheeting, diplomatics, 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...diplomatics, paper schredding, and someone to accept friend requests on my Facebook which usually are at 1000 a day.
- I have contacted both Bosnia and Russia.
I would like to have women here who behave. Bosnians and Russians.
I would like to have men here who can handle themselves and me and the women and if time permits the public and to train me and I them. It is important for me to pass this next along.
Focus is not depravity. A trained soldier can focus and take-care -of -Business.
Depravity is something that I am noticing in people. And I have an psychological fix that soldiers can use too.
The first step is to acknowledge depravity and sometimes that involves other people pointing it out and it is important to let it be acceptable.
Whe depravity is supported it turns into feeling down and the depravity is no longer an issue.
It is important for the feeling down to be as acceptable as possible and I have put into practice saying hello to members of my community who exhibit =present-medical= feeling down to be treated well. I recently noticed a woman sitting on the snow in Winnipeg while walking a long distance.
She said someting and I didn`t hear her due to some hearing loss and the surrounding traffic.
I indicated I couldn`t year by pointing to my ears and shrugging my shoulders and I walked closer. I can`t remember what she said but I asked her if she was okay because she looked down. Whe said her vagina hurt. I asked her if it was from her boyfriend. She said no. I gave her some medic type comments and left the area. After awhile I felt down.
As I walked on I eventually felt like why bother and I fought that with mental depravity. That turned into feeling down and the why bother until I felt the sunrise and the demons =vampires-medical= I was battling turned to dust and I had won. I saw a pair of white mitts on the ground and the woman I had spoke to was accross the street. I took the mitts and gave them to her and her face brightened. I left her and watched her go, makikng sure she was not accosted as she walked to out of eyesight.
I was taught from a very young age to hug which is an euphamism for sexual acts or approaches
I instinctively left the woman whe I first councselled her since I felt the desire to hug and both reasons are what made me feel down. That is why I eventually said why bother since I have no positive input.
I am looking into medical training and medical shorthand to eventually be an emergenccy room doctor. I have noticed ambulane workers here are less than ... . So a plan I have no authority to hatch is to hire foreigh professionals living in Canada who are not allowed to work as profesionals to work in supporting roles, sometimes returning to their home countries to train more and share about Canada, and if God willing eventually work as full doctors here initially supporting Canadians who are doctors as we Canadians need a lot of support
Bosnian soldiers retired can work at the Commissionaires. I suggest a $26 to $400 pre application fee to me via e-transfer. If not? The we ain`t friends and we ain`t allies and that makes us???
Russian soldiers could apply through me to work as Transit drivers in the City of Winnipeg. Long range goal is to provide transportation to and from Native Indian Reserves throughout the city. Transportation for Native Indians should be free as it is too time consuming to determine if it is actually for medical reasons. Many Native Indians in Winnipeg have no address. Another long range goal is to provide mail service to Native Indians as they travel in the comfort of City of Winnipeg busses.
I think Bosnian women would be Great at daycare. Then kindergarden, Then grade school. then high school. I am developing curriculim for children where they are not disabused or so harshly gateway`d
I think Russian women should work at small scale production of canola plants in what are now the many empty buildings in Winnipeg. The purchase of inside growing lights and other materials would inconvenience organized crime in their pursuit of illegal cannabis production. I would like to partner with engineers to produce security hardware and software for the women we employ and for our residences. Long range goal is to m a y b e have legal Russian Consular Divisions for all of the Canola Plant production facilities paying m a y b e Russian taxes. I would like to partner with legal to direct these activities
